<summary>Bug 07-API - Error Sending POST Request with Invalid String on dependent field</summary>


## Description

While using Postman to send a POST request to add a New employee, a 405 error is encountered when an invalid string value is provided as the dependent's field. The application should handle and validate input data to prevent the addition of invalid or incorrect values.


## Pre-condition

Have the valid Postman collection imported in Postman


## Steps To Reproduce

1. Launch Postman and access the QA Challenge- Master collection
2. Go to the POST request `Add Employee` for adding a new Employee.
3. On the Depndent field enter an invalid string (e.g., "X") as the dependent's number information.
4. Click on the Send button to send the POST request.

## Actual behavior
The server responds with a 405 Method Not Allowed error instead of handling the invalid input. The API does not return a clear validation error message
 indicating that the Dependents field contains invalid data.
## Expected behavior
When sending a POST request via Postman to add a new employee, if an invalid string value is provided in the Dependents field, 
the application should properly handle the input validation and return a meaningful error response.

Also the following would be expected:

-The API should validate the input before processing the request.
-If an invalid string is provided in the Dependents field, the API should return a 400 Bad Request status code instead of a 405 Method Not Allowed.
- The response body should include a clear error message, such as:   "error": "Invalid input: Dependents field must be a numeric value."

<summary>Bug 08-API -  Incorrect Response for DELETE Request with recently deleted Employee ID</summary>


## Description

When sending a DELETE request to remove an employee from the system, if an employee ID that has already been deleted, the application responds with a "200 OK" status. This behavior is misleading as it suggests successful deletion, even though the employee already does not exist in the first place.

## Pre-condition

Have the valid Postman collection imported in Postman


## Steps To Reproduce

1. Launch Postman and access the QA Challenge- Master collection
2. Go to the DELETE request `Delete Employee` to remove an Employee.
3. On the Request URL include an already deleted employee ID value of a user.
4. Click on the Send button to send the DELETE request.


## Actual behavior
The application accepts the DELETE request with  already deleted employee ID. The server responds with a "200 OK" status, which incorrectly suggests successful deletion.

## Expected behavior
The application should validate the provided employee ID to ensure that it exists in the system. If a non-existing or already deleted ID is detected, the application should return a "404 Not Found" status or an appropriate error response indicating that the employee does not exist.

## Priority
High

## Impact:
This issue has the following negative impacts:

Misleading Response: The "200 OK" status implies successful deletion when the employee does not exist, leading to confusion and incorrect assumptions.
Data Integrity: Users might believe they have successfully deleted a nonexistent employee, affecting data integrity and accuracy.
Ineffective Error Handling: The application fails to provide accurate error responses for such cases, making troubleshooting difficult.

<summary>Bug 09-API -  Incorrect Response for DELETE Request with Invalid Employee ID</summary>


## Description

When sending a DELETE request to remove an employee from the system, if an employee ID that has already been deleted, the application responds with a "405" error status. 

1. Launch Postman and access the QA Challenge- Master collection
2. Go to the DELETE request `Delete Employee` to remove an Employee.
3. On the Request URL include an invalid employee ID value of a user with wrong characters( i.e //4392990-3230023abcd-34234ddff).
4. Click on the Send button to send the DELETE request.


## Actual behavior
The API returns a 405 Method Not Allowed error which:
	‚Ä¢	The response does not provide a clear indication that the requested employee does not exist.
	‚Ä¢	The error message does not follow standard RESTful API conventions for handling resource deletion errors.
	‚Ä¢	The request method itself (DELETE) is valid, so a 405 status code is misleading in this context

## Expected behavior
The API should return a 404 Not Found status code instead of 405 Method Not Allowed if the Employee ID does not exist.
	‚Ä¢	The response body should provide a meaningful error message, such as:
 error": "Employee ID not found or non existing"
 The API should follow RESTful principles, ensuring correct error handling for resource deletion requests
## Priority
High

## Impact:
This issue has the following negative impacts:

The issue causes misleading error handling, as a 405 Method Not Allowed response suggests a method restriction instead of indicating that the Employee ID does not exist or has already been deleted. 
This leads to confusion for developers, inefficient debugging, and doesnt follow RESTful API usual conventions. 
It can also impact third-party integrations, user experience, and security. The correct approach is to return a 404 Not Found with a clear error message.

<summary>Bug 11-API -  500 Internal Server Error with Invalid ID in GET Request Body for GET Employee </summary>


## Description

When attempting to retreive an employee's information using a GET request, a 500 server error is encountered due to an invalid ID being provided in the request URL. The application should handle and validate input data to ensure that only valid IDs are accepted for updates

## Pre-condition

Have the valid Postman collection imported in Postman


## Steps To Reproduce

1. Launch Postman and access the QA Challenge- Master collection
2. Go to the GET request `GET Employee` to retrieve an Employee's information.
3. On the Request body include an invalid ID value of an Employee.( whatever input as ID on the id variable)
4. Click on the Send button to send the GET request.


## Actual behavior
The application accepts the GET request with an invalid ID value in the request URL.The server responds with a 500 internal server error message:
	‚Ä¢	The error indicates an unhandled exception rather than a properly managed validation failure.
	‚Ä¢	No clear message is provided to inform the user that the issue is due to an invalid Employee ID.
	‚Ä¢	The request causes a server-side failure, potentially exposing internal system vulnerabilities.

## Expcted behavior
The API should validate the Employee ID before processing the request.
Additionally:

-If an invalid or non-existent ID is provided, the API should return a 400 Bad Request (if the format is incorrect) or a 404 Not Found (if the ID does not exist).
-A meaningful error message should be returned, such as:
error": "Invalid Employee ID. Please provide a valid identifier."

2.Click on the `Add Employee` button or edit on an existing employee

3.Input on the First Name field or Last Name field numbers or combination of letters and numbers.

4.Proceed with adding the employee by clicking on the `Add button`


## Actual behavior
  ‚Ä¢	The UI accepts numeric characters in the First Name and Last Name fields.
	‚Ä¢	The system successfully saves the employee without validation errors.
	‚Ä¢	The invalid name is displayed in the employee list and details page

## Expected behavior
  ‚Ä¢	The First Name and Last Name fields should only accept alphabetic characters.
	‚Ä¢	If a user enters numbers, the system should display a validation error message, such as:
 First Name and Last Name must contain only letters."

<summary>Bug 15-UI -No Validation Error Message for Invalid Dependent Field Input</summary>


## Description

When a user enters invalid input (e.g., letters or special characters) in the Dependent field while adding or editing an employee, the UI correctly prevents the adding or editing with invalid character but does not display any validation error message. 
This creates a poor user experience, as users are unaware of why they cannot proceed .

## Pre-condition

Access to the Paylocity Employee Management System.


## Steps To Reproduce

1.Go to link for the application to login at https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/Account/Login

2.Enter valid details for Username and password and click on the Login button

2.Click on the `Add Employee` button or edit icon on an existing employee

3.Go to the Dependent field an enter an invalid character. 
4. Try to Add or Update the employee


## Actual behavior
    
  ‚Ä¢ The UI prevents submission when invalid input is entered.
	‚Ä¢	No validation error message is displayed, leaving users confused about why they cannot proceed.
	‚Ä¢	Users have no guidance on the expected input format.

## Expected behavior
  The UI should display a clear validation error message when invalid input is detected, such as:
Error: "Invalid input: The Dependent field must contain only numbers."

## Priority
Medium
